<h2 class="monospace-text"><u>Why Australia should move to regulate Big Tech</u></h2>
<p class="blog">
<br>
Big technology companies like Facebook and Google make millions of dollars a year from Australian consumers and advertisers. Their platforms also subtly promote harmful content including misinformation, political extremism, and scams. The main issue that seems not to be understood by the Australian Government, is that this is by design. Artificial Intelligence systems designed to optimise for time on site promote this kind of content, which leads people to share, react, and engage, further spreading negativity. The debate around this topic largely boils down to a few opposing arguments or groups.
<br>
<br>
<b>1) pro-regulation.</b>
<br>
<br>
They argue that we need to regulate social media, as it promotes harmful content, and that harmful content spreads faster than neutral content. They argue this incentivises people and news organisations to post and produce content in a certain kind of style that is corrosive to civil discource and the social fabric.
<br>
<br>
<b>2) free speech free markets.</b>
<br>
<br>
They argue that social media companies have the freedom to innovate, and that to place restrictions on what content these platforms can promote is an infringement on freedom of speech.
<br>
<br>
<i>Associations: Silicon Valley, Venture Capital, Technological Utopianism, Neoliberalism, Wall Street.</i>
<br><br>
<b>3) anti-rationalist cancel culture.</b>
<br><br>
They argue that certain people or groups on social media need to be 'cancelled' or banned, treated as political outcasts because of their views. This is largely a reaction to negative content that has been promoted for profit.
<br><br>
<i>Associations: Far Left, Wokeism.</i>
<br><br>
<b>4) populist anti-elitism.</b> 
<br><br>
With relationships to more right wing ideologies and similarities to the free speech and free markets group, this group believes that the mainstream media are liberal elites who control public information and tell everyday people what to think. They believe that the traditional, mainstream media, manipulate news and are corrupt. This is typically associated with a distrust of institutions and conspiracy theories.

<i>Associations: Far Right, Breitbart, Trump, Brexit, Populism.</i>
<br><br>
The algorithms and AI that social media companies use to keep people engaged and addicted to online media are not regulated by governments. People focus more on the content as the problem, and seem to forget about the algorithm that is driving the content and the engagement. This is actually an age old problem of media, which Marshal McLuhan recognised when he famously said "the medium is the message". The medium in which content is presented, is actually more powerful and more influential to the viewer, than the content itself.
<br><br>
People are focused on the content of the medium, not the medium itself. The medium is driven by AI, it can be thought of as a combination of the user's temperament and the AI driving the choice of promoted content. The AI and algorithms promote and sort through different content to  maximise time on site and engagement of the end user. The government and general public tend to forget this, and focus on the content itself as the problem. The far [right] [left] extremist posts, the polarising news article, sensationalist headline or video title. In forgetting that the medium is the message, we attempt to treat the symptoms of the problem not the cause, and instead create organisations to prevent misinformation, and hire more police to prevent outbreaks of public violence, for example. This is expensive and ultimately unsustainable because, in the long run, the technology will continue to advance in sophistication.
<br><br> 
Social media companies and technology companies that use AI need to be regulated, just like many other industries are regulated. The technology is only going to increase in sophistication, the AI will get more nuanced and predictive in its recommendations. The debate at the moment around regulation is not a mature one. People focus more on the political in-fighting on social media, rather than thinking about the medium itself and the psychological manipulation that occurs on behalf of social media giants through the technology. The focus is more on the message, and people forget about the medium, which leads to a kind of collective hypnosis.</p>
